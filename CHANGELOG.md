## 1.1.0 - 2019-01-14

- Interface updates:
	- The Skeleton Extension can no longer be installed on phpBB 3.1 boards. The minimum requirement is now phpBB 3.2.0 or newer. (Note that you can still create skeletons that will support and run on phpBB 3.1 boards).
	- The components section of the web UI has been organized into categories to improve the user experience when choosing what the Skeleton will create.
	- The web UI user documentation link has been enhanced with a graphic icon to improve its visibility.
- Skeleton updates:
	- Skeleton files have dropped the use of "Acme" and "Demo" in favor of your own vendor and extension names. 
	- Skeleton template files now use TWIG syntax instead of old phpBB 3.0 style template syntax.
	- Improved distinctions between skeletons designed to be compatible with phpBB >=3.1 vs. >=3.2. For example, skeletons built to support 3.1 and above will still use the User object for language functions, while skeletons built for 3.2 and above will use the newer Language object for language functions.
	- All skeleton files have been overhauled with improved DocBlock and sample code that exemplifies phpBB's coding guidelines and best practices.
	- ACP, UCP, and MCP modules have been updated to utilise controller classes.

- Fixed an issue where the controller component did not generate a correct event listener.
- Fixed an issue where the controller component did not generate a template event listener for the controller's nav-bar link.
- Fixed an issue where the notification component did not generate a valid ext.php (references to the notification services will now have the correct vendor and ext names instead of "dev.dev").

- Skeleton config service files correctly encapsulate all strings in quotes that begin with @ and % per Symfony specifications.
- Skeleton PHP files have all their DocBlocks updated to be consistent with PSR-5 recommendations.
